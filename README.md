To pull a repository from GitHub and execute a script from it on a plain Debian installation in WSL, you'll need to first ensure that you have git installed, and then clone the repository. After cloning, you can navigate to the directory where the script is located and execute it. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Git**:
   - Open your WSL terminal.
   - Since this is a plain Debian installation, first update your package list and then install git. Run the following commands:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install git
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository from GitHub by running:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/FriedrichGrey/dotfiles.git
     ```
   - This clones the repository into a `dotfiles` directory in your current working directory.

3. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**:
   - Change your current directory to the `dotfiles` directory:
     ```bash
     cd dotfiles
     ```

4. **Make the Script Executable** (if not already):
   - Before executing `startup.sh`, make sure it has execute permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod +x startup.sh
     ```

5. **Execute the `startup.sh` Script**:
   - Run the script with the following command:
     ```bash
     ./startup.sh
     ```

6. **Follow Any On-Screen Instructions**:
   - If the script has prompts or requires user input, follow the on-screen instructions.
